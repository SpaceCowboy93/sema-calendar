# Release Candidate Data Audit

**Branch:** `security/phase-1-auth-foundation`
**Date:** 2026-10-08
**Auditor:** Claude Code (automated review)
**Commits reviewed:** 5 (f0287d7 → a86a538, relative to `main`)

---

## Executive Summary

The five commits introduce: email/password authentication with safe error
classification, a critical egress fix (background-tab polling guard), fallback
polling raised to five minutes, and regression tests for all three behaviors.

**No data-loss or data-corruption path was found.** The authentication flow
correctly validates couple membership before any shared state is loaded. The
three-way sync merge is mathematically sound and all edge cases tested pass.

The only blocker for production is an unrelated billing restriction on
Supabase project `neyhoodxeumpbxekskej` (HTTP 402, `exceed_egress_quota`,
active as of 2026-10-08). This branch cannot be exercised end-to-end until
that restriction is lifted via the Supabase dashboard.

## Findings by Severity

### MEDIUM — Inconsistent error classification on mount-time redirect

**File:** [src/app/page.tsx](../src/app/page.tsx) lines 22–24
**Status:** Known inconsistency; low practical risk

The `useEffect` that auto-redirects already-authenticated users catches
failures from `getVerifiedAccess()` and surfaces `failure.message` directly:

```ts
setError(failure instanceof Error ? failure.message : 'Unable to verify account access.')
```

The `handleSubmit` path (the user-visible sign-in flow) correctly delegates to
`classifyAuthError`. The mount-time path does not.

In practice the risk is low because `getVerifiedAccess` raises `AccessError`
for most failure modes, and `AccessError` messages are written by the app
(they are already safe). A raw Supabase network error on initial page load
would only be surfaced if `getVerifiedAccess` itself throws a non-AccessError
(e.g., a `TypeError` from a completely offline browser).

**Recommendation:** Replace `failure.message` with `classifyAuthError(failure)`
in the mount-handler catch block to make the two paths consistent.

---

### LOW — `throw signInError` preserves `.status`; relies on duck-typing

**File:** [src/app/page.tsx](../src/app/page.tsx) line 36
**Status:** Correct; worth documenting

Before this commit, the sign-in error was re-wrapped:
```ts
throw new Error(signInError.message)
```
This stripped the `.status` field that `classifyAuthError` uses (Rule 2).

The fix (`throw signInError`) correctly preserves the Supabase `AuthError`
shape. `classifyAuthError` reads `.status` via duck-typing
(`'status' in error`), not via `instanceof AuthApiError`, so no Supabase SDK
type needs to be imported. This is intentional and correct.

---

### INFO — `selectSharedState` zero-value and false-value handling

**File:** [src/lib/shared-state.ts](../src/lib/shared-state.ts) line 19–22
**Status:** Correct; regression tests added (see Part 2)

`monthlyIncome: 0`, `boomBoomCount: 0`, and `focusCarryOver: false` all pass
through `selectSharedState` correctly:

- `typeof 0 === 'number' && Number.isFinite(0)` → `true` → value kept
- `typeof false === 'boolean'` → `true` → value kept

This means setting income to zero or disabling focus carry-over will sync
correctly and will not be silently dropped. No change needed; tests added to
confirm this invariant.

---

### INFO — `sameValue([], [])` is intentionally true

**File:** [src/lib/sync-merge.ts](../src/lib/sync-merge.ts) line 9–11
**Status:** Correct

Two empty arrays compare as equal (`length 0`, `every()` vacuously true).
This means clearing a list (e.g., deleting all events) is recognised as "same
as base" only when base is also empty. If base had items, the empty local array
signals a deletion and the merge proceeds into the array-id path. No action.

---

### INFO — Realtime channel per lifecycle, not per couple

**File:** [src/hooks/useSupabaseSync.ts](../src/hooks/useSupabaseSync.ts) line 253
**Status:** No data issue; minor resource concern

A new Realtime channel is created each time the hook mounts. If a route
unmounts and remounts quickly (e.g., tab close/open with React StrictMode in
dev), two channels could briefly overlap before the cleanup runs
`supabase.removeChannel`. This does not cause data loss because both channels
call the same `pull()` function which is guarded by `reading=true`. The extra
channel is cleaned up asynchronously. No action needed for production.

---

### INFO — `deleteShoppingList` reverses finance sync only for completed lists

**File:** [src/store/useAppStore.ts](../src/store/useAppStore.ts) lines 904–914
**Status:** Correct

Completed lists may have a linked `financeItemId`. On deletion, the store
un-does the finance entry (sets `isCompleted: false` to trigger the reverse
sync). Active (incomplete) lists have no finance entry, so the simple
`filter(l => l.id !== id)` is sufficient. No action needed.

## Conclusion

The branch is safe to merge once the Supabase billing restriction is lifted.
The MEDIUM finding (inconsistent error path on mount) is a cosmetic issue that
can be addressed in a follow-up commit without blocking the release.

**Required before merge:**
1. Resolve Supabase quota restriction via billing dashboard
2. End-to-end smoke test on restored project (`npm run test:e2e`)

**Optional follow-up (non-blocking):**
1. Apply `classifyAuthError` to the mount-time catch in `src/app/page.tsx`
