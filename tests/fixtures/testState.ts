 *   - Does NOT connect to the production Supabase database.
 *   - Uses a fixed test user ("mateo") to satisfy the auth gate.
 *   - Provides just enough data to exercise navigation flows.
 *
 * The Zustand persist key is "semacalendar-v1".
 * currentUser is excluded from persist (transient) and must be set
 * via a separate sessionStorage key or directly onto the store via
 * a script injected before page load.
